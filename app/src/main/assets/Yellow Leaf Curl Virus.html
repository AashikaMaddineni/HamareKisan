    <h2> Caused By:</h2>

    <p> Virus (TYLCV) </p>
    <br />
    <h2> Stages:</h2>
    <p> Vegetative state, Flowering stage, Harvesting stage </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
    <p> Yellow and curled leaves. Stunted growth. Less number of fruits. </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Organic Control:</h2>
    <p> There is no treatment against TYLCV. Control the whitefly population to avoid the infection with the virus. </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Chemical Control</h2>
   <p>
    Once infected with the virus, there are no treatments against the infection. Control the whitefly population to avoid the infection with the virus. Insecticides of the family of the pyrethroids used as soil drenches or spray during the seedling stage can reduce the population of whiteflies. However, their extensive use might promote resistance development in whitefly populations..
