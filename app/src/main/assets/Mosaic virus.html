    <h2> Caused By:</h3>
    <p> Virus (CMV) </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Stages:</h3>
    <p>Vegetative state, Flowering stage. </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Symptoms:</h3>
    <p> Yellow mosaic patterns on leaves and fruits. Downward bending and crinkling leaves and petioles. Stunted and deformed growth.  White streakes on flowers. </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Organic Control:</h3>
    <p> Application of mineral oil sprays on leaves can deter aphids from feeding on them and can thereby control the population. </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Chemical Control</h3>
    <p> Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. There are no effective chemicals against CMV, nor any that protect plants from becoming infected. Insecticides containing cypermethrin or chlorpyrifos can be used as foliar spray against aphids.</p>
