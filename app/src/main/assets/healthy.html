    <p>Fertilize with the right and a balanced nutrient supply. Do not over-water the crop during the season. Remove diseased leaves, fruit or branches at right time during the growing season. Use biological treatments in case of pests and diseases. As long as preventive measures are followed and care is taken to give plants what they need, no chemical control should be needed!</p>
