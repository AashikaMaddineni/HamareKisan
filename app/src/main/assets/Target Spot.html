    <h2> Caused By:</h3>
    <p> Fungus (Corynespora cassiicola) </p>
    <br />
    <h2> Stages:</h3>
    <p> Vegetative state, Flowering stage </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Symptoms:</h3>
    <p> Look for the disease on the bottom leaves. Tiny brown spots with yellow margins. Larger spots up to 10 mm that have ring patterns. Spots may be present on the stems and on the fruit. </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Organic Control:</h3>
    <p> Remove a few branches from the lower part of the plants to allow better airflow at the base
        Remove and burn the lower leaves as soon as the disease is seen, especially after the lower fruit trusses have been picked.
        Keep plots free from weeds, as some may be hosts of the fungus.
        Do not use overhead irrigation; otherwise, it will create conditions for spore production and infection.  </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Chemical Control</h3>
   <p>
    Warm wet conditions favour the disease such that fungicides are needed to give adequate control. The products to use are chlorothalonil, copper oxychloride or mancozeb. Treatment should start when the first spots are seen and continue at 10-14-day intervals until 3-4 weeks before last harvest. It is important to spray both sides of the leaves.
