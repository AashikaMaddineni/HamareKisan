    <h2> Caused By:</h3>
    <p> Fungus (Mycovellosiella fulva) </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Stages:</h3>
    <p> Flowering stage</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Symptoms:</h3>
    <p>Pale green or yellowish diffuse spots on upper leaf side. Olive green to grayish purple patches on underside. Drying and curling of leaves.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Organic Control:</h3>
    <p> Seed treatment with hot water (25 minutes at 122 °F or 50 °C) is recommended to avoid the pathogen on seeds. The fungi Acremonium strictum, Dicyma pulvinata, Trichoderma harzianum or T. viride and Trichothecium roseum are antagonistic to M. fulva and could be used to reduce its spread. In greenhouse trials the growth of M. fulva on tomatoes was inhibited by A. strictum, Trichoderma viride strain 3 and T. roseum by 53, 66 and 84% respectively. In small arms, apple-cider, garlic or milk sprays and vinegar mix can be used to treat the mold. </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Chemical Control</h3>
    <p>
        Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Applications should be made prior to infection when environmental conditions are optimal for the development of the disease. Recommended compounds in field use are chlorothalonil, maneb, mancozeb and copper formulations. For greenhouses, difenoconazole, mandipropamid, cymoxanil, famoxadone and cyprodinil are recommended.
