    <h1> Bacterial Spot  </h1>
    <img src='file:///android_asset/Bacterial_spot.png'  style=" width: 40%; padding-left: 30% ;padding-right: 30%;"/>
    
    <h2> Caused By:</h3>
    <p> Bacteria (Xanthomonas spp. & Pseudomonas syringae pv. Tomato). </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Stages:</h3>
    <p>Vegetative state, Flowering stage, Fruiting stage, Harvesting stage</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Symptoms:</h3>
    <p>Small dark spots with a yellow halo on leaves and fruits. Stem and flower stalk also affected. </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Organic Control:</h3>
    <p>Bacterial Spot is very expensive to treat. If disease occurs early in the season consider destroying the entire crop. Copper containing bactericides provide a protective cover on foliage and fruit for both bacteria. Bacterial viruses that specifically kill the bacteria are available for bacterial spot. Submerging seeds for one minute in 1.3% sodium hypochlorite or in hot water(50o C) for 25 minutes can reduce the incidence of disease</p>
